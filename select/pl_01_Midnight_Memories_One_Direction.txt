Straight off the plane to
a new hotel
Just touched down
you could never tell
Big house party
with a crowded kitchen
People talk shit
but we don't listen
Tell me that I'm wrong
but I do what I please
Way too many people
in the Addison Lee
Now I'm at the age
when I know
what I need oohh
Midnight memories
oh oh oh
Baby you and me
Stumbling in the street
Singing singing
singing singing
Midnight memories
oh oh oh
Anywhere we go
Never saying no
Just do it do it do it do it
5 foot something
with the skinny jeans
Don't look backbaby
follow me
I don't know
where I'm going
but I'm finding my way
Same old shit
but a different day
Tell me that I'm wrong
but I do what I please
Way too many people
in the Addison Lee
Now I'm at the age
when I know
what I need oohh
Midnight memories
oh oh oh
Baby you and me
Stumbling in the street
Singing singing
singing singing
Midnight memories
oh oh oh
Anywhere we go
Never saying no
Just do it do it do it
You and me
and all our friends
I don't care how much
we spend
Baby this is what the night is
oh oh oh
I know
nothing's making sense
For tonight lets just pretend
I don't wanna stop
so give me more
Midnight memories oh oh oh
Baby you and me
Stumbling in the street
Singin singin singin singin
Midnight memories oh oh oh
Anywhere we go
Never saying no
Just do it do it do it do it
