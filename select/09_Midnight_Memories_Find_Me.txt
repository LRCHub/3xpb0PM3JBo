Where do we go from here
Staring into space
It looks like the atmosphere
Was lost without a trace

Loosing you
Was always on the cards
I tell you one thing
I'd give you everything
Over and over again

Give it all you got and don't look back
Even if you can't get back to life
Can remember where I used to be
Know the world is waiting there for me
Give it all you got and don't look back
You could be the winner with a loosing hand
Take a look around and you will see
The midnight memories

I wanna turn around
And drive back to the start
'couse all that i left behind
Is tearin' me apart

Loosing you
Is always on the cards
I tell you one thing
I'd give you everything
Over and over again

Give it all you got and dont look back
Even if you can't get back to life
Can't remember where i used to be
Know the world is waiting there for me
Give it all you got and don't look back
You could be the winner with a loosing hand
Take a look around and you will see
The midnight memories

Ooooh yeah

Give it all you got and don't look back
Even if you can't get back to life
Can remember where i used to be
Know the world is waiting there for me
Give it all you got and don't look back
You could be the winner with a loosing hand
Take a look around and you will see
The midnight memories

Ooooh yeah
Take a look around
And don't look back
Get back to life
Give it all you got and don't look back
With a loosing hand
You will see
The midnight memories
